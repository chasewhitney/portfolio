At the basic staff level, users will be able to enter morning and afternoon goal completion, view previous daysâ€™ entries, and mark a participant absent. Case managers will also be able to create and edit personalized goals for participants and review summary data for three month and six month periods in order to write reports. Location administrators will be able to manage staff, including add and delete staff accounts; manage participants, including adding and removing participants and assigning case managers; and managing job site information.

Created events appear in a Google Maps UI which can be interacted with, allowing users to review event details, save the event to a My Events section and request approval from the host to attend the event. Once the event host approves a request to attend, the approved user has access to the event's address.",
